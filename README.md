# Event Manager Application

A simple Node.js/Express application for managing events with EJS templating.

## Overview

This event manager application allows users to create and view events. It's built with Node.js, Express, and EJS templates for server-side rendering.

> ðŸš§ **Note:** A React frontend for this application is planned and will be available in a separate repository.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS Templates
- MongoDB (for data storage)
- Mongoose (for database modeling)
- dotenv (for environment variables)

## Features

- Create events with details
- View list of all events
- About and Contact pages
- Simple and intuitive UI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/2sipping0/event-manager-backend.git
   cd event-manager-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   dbURL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```
   
   For development with auto-restart:
   ```
   npm install -g nodemon
   nodemon app.js
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

```

## Database Schema

The application uses a MongoDB database with a simple Event model. The schema includes fields for event details (exact fields based on your Event model).

## Template Structure

The application uses EJS templating with partials for consistent layout across pages:
- Header, nav and footer partials for consistent navigation and page structure
- Event-specific partials for reusable components in the events section
- Templates receive data like `{ page: 'pageName', title: 'Page Title' }` for dynamic content

## Future Development

- User authentication
- Event editing and deletion functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- A React frontend is planned and will be available in a separate repository
